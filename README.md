# Lit Ecosystem Ideas ðŸ’«

Lit Protocol is a distributed key management network for encryption, signing, and compute. Check out the Lit [docs](https://developer.litprotocol.com/whatIsLit) to learn more.

Here, you will find a list of project ideas focused on expanding the functionality of Lit-enabled apps, infrastructure, and web3 as a whole. There are two categories:

### Projects
Formal requests for contribution. Projects are divided into concrete milestones with clear deliverables. Projects are designed to enhance the functionality or feature set of the underlying Lit Protocol stack.

### Ideas
General, high-level ideas or feature requests. Ideas are more broad compared to Projects. Each idea should contain a description of the problem (what does this idea look to solve / enable), the applicable product (i.e. 'encryption' or 'signing'), and a list of desired components. 

This list is constantly growing. If you have an idea, please submit it below!
